OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
We have the following broad categories of classifying datatypes
  1.  inbuilt datatypes-- this are those that come with the programming language
  eg. in py we have int,float,str,bool,list,tuple,set,dict
  2. user defined data types-- are those that are created by the programmer--enaled by the use of classes and objects eg person,student,car
**OOP**-->A programming paradigm that buids programs around classes and objects
**classes**->A  blueprint or a template for creating objects
**objects**--> an instance of a clas
a class has the followin 2 things
 1. Attribtes--> the variables holding data in a class..they answer the question:what does a class have
 eg. class person-name,age,height,weight,marital status,
 class car- engine,yom,make,model,colour,horsepower,torque
 class laptop-- width,ram,processors,storage
 2. Behaviour
     ->defined by methos
     -> mthods are simply funtions inside classes
     ->behaviour answers the quesion what can a class do?
     eg class person--walk,talk,eat,sleep,work
     class car-start,move,stop
     class laptop-start,shutdown,code send mail
**methods**-->unctions insideclasses
**constuctor**--> a special method used to initialize objects
-->it is automatically called when an object is created
-->python constructor is ** def __init__(self,parameters)
**self**--> references the object itself
**parameters**





**Inheritance**
-->This is a concept that allows one class to acquire/inherit properties from another class
-->it allows you to re use code instead of rewritting everything

**why do we need inheritance**
1. it avoids duplicated code
2. adds new features to an existing class
3. allows a behaviour modification

**child class**-the class nheriting props from another class--also called derived class
**paent class**--the class from which prperties are inherited--also called the base class

**types of inheritance**
1. single inheritance-- child class inherits from a single parent class
2. multiple inheritance--a child class inherits from more than one parent class
3. multilevel in heritance--a child class nherits from a parent and the parent also inherits from another class


**method overriding**--> occcurs when a child provides its own implementation ofa method that alredy exists in the parent class...so basically the childs method replaces the parents method when called by the child object



Flask
1. Routing
->A mechanism to map/connect urls to python functions. its a a system for resource navigation--connects a ur to a function in your flask app
**URL** - Uniform Resource Locater- full address used to access resources on the web
**parts of a url**
1. protocol--tells the browser how to communicate eh http and https
**http** -sends data as raw text
**https** - data is encrypted
2. domain name-name of the website eg meet.google.com
3. port (optional)-where exactly to find the service
4. path-the specific page or resource eg /about, /contacts

in Flask, routing is executed using a decorator function--->@app.route()
**Decorator Function**-->a function that allows you to modify the behaviour of another function-->they have the prefix @

The @app.route() decorator function can take some parameters eg
a) Rule/path--the path that a user accesses
b)Methods
**index route** - / --> default home/landing page

@app.route()-----decorator function(enables routing)
def home():---->view function__responsible for returning resources
    return "This is the index route"--->resource to be returned

**every view function must have its own unique name**   



*Instead of returning raw data in our routes , we instead return / render full html pages and the subsequently render our data in those pages *To render /return html pages in Flask , we use a function called render_template() which is imported from Flask *The render_template() function takes as an argument the name of a html file in string format e.g. render_template("index.html")

TEMPLATE INHERITANCE A mechanism of reducing redundancy in creating html files by having one base template which contains all common html components e.g navbar , footer -> Uses Jinja syntax -> Create one base template -> base.html, layout.html -> Have the other html files inherit common features from it

{% extends 'base.html' %} --> inherit features from base template {% block title %} {% endblock %}---> where to put my title for child templates {% block content %} {% endblock %} --> block where you place each page's unique content

Task: - Apply template inheritance to the remaining html files


**Display Data in the browser/clients**
->how? - Tables
-->database-->flask--->html

jinja
{% %}
 - a syntax inbuilt with flask to render python data
 -a templating engine intergrated with flask to render dynamic html pages

**KEY FEATURES OF JINJA**
1. when handling variables use the following jinja syntax-{{}}
2. when handling control structures - {%  %}
**control structures** this are the building blocks that manage the flow of the execution in a programme
 a) sequence-> programmes execute top to bottom and left to right
 b)selection
  ->decision making in a programme
  ->conditional statements-->if....else..
 c)repitition
  ->loop--> for and while loops

**jinja control structures syntax**
for loop
       
       {% for .... %}--initialization

       {% endfor %}---termination

       {% if.... %}

       {% endif %}





**Posting data from the client**
posting-- sending data to a server

**steps**
1. user is going to be provided with a form to fill some data
2. user submits the form--submitted to a flask route
3. flask extracts data from the form and processes it
   -> data coming from this form comes in the format of key-value pairs
   "product_name":"eggs"
   "buying_price":"29"
   value--whatever the user fills in the form
   key--defined by the name attribute in form input
     ->we extract form data using a request object which has access to the following methods
           a)  request.form--used to access and extract form values using the key
           b)request.method--method used to determine method defined
4. store/insert data using our functions
5. redirect the user
   -> we redirect a user using the redirect and url_for methods
   ->redirect()->functionality to enable redirection
   ->url_for()--where exactly do i take a user?
              ---takes

**form checklist**
a) action attribute
    ->an attribute that defines the route where the form data is to be submitted for processing
    e.g action ='/add_products'
b) method
    ->what do you want the server to do with the source/data
c) name attribute
    -> a key used to access and extract values from  the form input
d) input type
    ->eg email,number,text,password
e) button - type submit

      **http methods**
      ->GET--Getting/fetching data e.g. displaying products/sales,getting ig posts,tweets
      ->POST-sending ata to a server e.g. adding products,making sales,tweeting
      ->PUT--updating an existing resource e.g. changing password,changing product name
      ->DELETE--getting rid of a resource--e.g. deleting a product
      **http status code
      100-199--informational responses
      200-299-- successful repsomses
      300-399---redirection messages
      400-499 --client err
