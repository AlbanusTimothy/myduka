OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
We have the following broad categories of classifying datatypes
  1.  inbuilt datatypes-- this are those that come with the programming language
  eg. in py we have int,float,str,bool,list,tuple,set,dict
  2. user defined data types-- are those that are created by the programmer--enaled by the use of classes and objects eg person,student,car
**OOP**-->A programming paradigm that buids programs around classes and objects
**classes**->A  blueprint or a template for creating objects
**objects**--> an instance of a clas
a class has the followin 2 things
 1. Attribtes--> the variables holding data in a class..they answer the question:what does a class have
 eg. class person-name,age,height,weight,marital status,
 class car- engine,yom,make,model,colour,horsepower,torque
 class laptop-- width,ram,processors,storage
 2. Behaviour
     ->defined by methos
     -> mthods are simply funtions inside classes
     ->behaviour answers the quesion what can a class do?
     eg class person--walk,talk,eat,sleep,work
     class car-start,move,stop
     class laptop-start,shutdown,code send mail
**methods**-->unctions insideclasses
**constuctor**--> a special method used to initialize objects
-->it is automatically called when an object is created
-->python constructor is ** def __init__(self,parameters)
**self**--> references the object itself
**parameters**
